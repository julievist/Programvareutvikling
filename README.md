### Userstories

To follow the scrum development method we have made a list of userstories that we then break into issues that you can find in the [issueboard](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/tdt4140-2023/landsby-2/gruppe-28/imdbooks/-/boards). The list is as follows: 

1. As a user i want a homepage containing news, toplists, favorites and books soon to be realesed in order to have a good user experience and to get the most out of the website.
2. As an administrator i want to be able to add new books and authors to give users the possibility to discover new reading material.
3. As a user i want to be able to search for books using title or authors in order to find information about books or authors i have heard about.
4. As a user i want to be able to review books that i have read so that other users can get an impression about the books quality.
5. As a user i want to be able to sort books based on genres in order to find new books in my favorite genres. 
6. As an administrator i want to be able to delete non serious or vulgar comments to keep the website professional.
7. As a user i want to be able to log in to a usersystem that allows me to create custom lists such as favorites and books i have read. 
8. As a user i want to see the rating of a book based on the average rating given in all the reviews in order to get a sense of the books quality.
9. As a user i want a toplist made by a realiable source such as New York Times to get inspiration on what i should read next. 
10. As the product owner i want to be able to advertise on the website in order to make money that can then be used to finance the website.
